## Learning Experience 
Creating custom theme form scratch is difficult for the amount of css involved and we also got to learn about plugins. This is first time i'm creating a wordpress based project everything was far more different than usual we learnt about widgets, php-admin, making changes in wp-config, and generally about what is customizing everthing possible for a website.
